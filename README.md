### ideation plan

### process & iteration

We primarily used an app called [SensorLog](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sensorlog/id388014573?mt=8) to collect data. We faced a couple of hiccups with this, since SensorLog seems to have some errors in data collection that we can't really explain. We managed to get access to a home-grown accelerometer app, but faced the issue of our data having different formats to work in.

As our data cleaning became more sophisticated, we also began to collect more intentional data. In order to deal with the problem of **classification**, we collected data for _line dances_ (the wobble and the cupid shuffle(, _structured dance_ (zumba and salsa), and _motion data_ (walking and running). This data was usable for our work with **visualization**.

### results
Some of our key findings were (see poster at end for analysis details):

### next steps
Overall, some of our basic questions seem to be answered:

###feasibility

###artifacts
